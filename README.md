# whosonduty-api

This tracker fetches its data from the whosonduty API. Access is currently private due.

# Impact

"whosonduty" was presented to LMU Student Housing during an in-service CDT meeting. Its purpose is to help give off-duty RAs a better work-life balance, as residents currently have no way of knowing who the current RA(s) on duty actually are.

# Analytics

Since release after the November CDT meeting, whosonduty has been used for almost every building by 112 users. Desmond, Del Rey South, Leavey 5 & 6, and Palm South have the highest userbase with posters up containing QR codes.
