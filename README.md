# File Structure

This app was originally built with React using TypeScript and later updated to Next.js.

```
.
└── legacy          # The original code written for the project
└── src              # Redesigned code migrated to Next.js functions
```

# Impact

"whosonduty" was originally presented to LMU Student Housing during an in-service CDT meeting. Its purpose is to help give off-duty RAs a better work-life balance, as on-campus residents currently have no way of knowing who the current RA(s) on duty actually are.

# analytics

Since release after the November CDT meeting, whosonduty has been used for almost every building by over 100 users monthly. Desmond, Del Rey South, Leavey 5 & 6, and Palm South have the highest userbase with posters up containing QR codes.
